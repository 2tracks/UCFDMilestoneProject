# User Centric Frontend Milestone Project - Resume


This is my first Milestone Project at Codeinstitute for the User Centric Front End and I chose to make a responsive Resume Website.
The reason why I've chosen to make a responsive Resume is because I would like to have my own website with my resume on it so employers can see what I am able to do.

My Resume website has four sites a landing, about, work and contact page.

## UX

I put my first idea on paper in form of a mockup but I quickly moved over to [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html?sdid=88X75SKR&mv=search&ef_id=Cj0KCQiAvJXxBRCeARIsAMSkApokdEG1qLZ7AAelXbuk6Bx77_dvxmhqV1YGRG5SvEHNoULkb9UrjbsaAjVqEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!340667162876!e!!g!!adobe%20xd) to create a design.
XD is ideal to create designs because you can create it as it would look like on the Website.
If you would have a customer you could share your link to display them how it would look like and you 
could to adjustments before you start to code.

I included a link to my desing here [AdobeXD Design](https://xd.adobe.com/view/7c4d4b34-2d35-4f75-6c94-dc922dd6e609-0a7c/?hints=off)

I included a screenshot in the misc folder called adobeXD-design.pdf

## Features

- The Landing Page provides a list of social media links and an overview.The Social section and the Footer section are on every site the same for easy access to information and a download CV link.
- On the About Page you have a Bio with a short description and a Front End and Back End section to describe what I can do on both site's.
- The Work Page is where all the projects are for employers to explore.
- On the Contact Page is a responsive form to ask for information. At the moment this is pointing to http://formdump.codeinstitute.net.

## Technologies Used

This Resume website is build with HTML and CSS without any custome Javascript.
The Framework I used is [Bootstrap 4.4.1](https://getbootstrap.com/) to simplify the responsive behaviour in particular the responsive grid system
 and [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the icons.

 <br>

## Testing
<br>

I tested the Resume Website with the Chrome Webdeveloper tools and in addition I pushed it to my Github repository and used GitHub Pages to view and test the website on my phone.

<br>

## Deployment

I developed the Resume website with [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/) which made the deployment to [GitHub](https://github.com) very easy.
With [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/) you have to make a [GitHub](https://github.com) repository and you can deploy it by using `git push`.
On [GitHub](https://github.com/) you can use `GitHub pages` by choosing settings and then GitHub Pages and the Branch you would like to publish
